Portfolio for 94470 Telling stories with data at CMU
Andrew ID: mlaracue

# About me
I'm Maria Lara, a 2nd-year student of the MISM-BIDA 16-month program at Heinz. Before joining CMU, I worked for 6+ years at a people analytics consulting company in Colombia, my home country. For the last year-and-a-half, I led the data science unit. During my time with them, I developed a strong passion for visualizing data and persuading audiences through the use of data and analytics. The first time I heard about the importance of visualizations was thanks to a [TED talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVimVzgtD6w) by Hans Rosling, co-founder of the Gapminder Foundation, who promoted the *intelligent* use of visualizations to explore development issues. If you haven't seen his TED talks, I highly recommend them! It's such a shame he's no longer in this world.

# What I hope to learn
As I'm going to IBM as a data science consultant upon graduation, I want to hone my skills when delivering data-driven results to clients. I've seen how good narrative can be decisive regardless of how sound the analysis can be; if the client doesn't understand the value in what you did and why it matters to them, it's work lost in most cases. I'm confident this course will help me to achieve my goal.
