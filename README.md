Portfolio for 94470 Telling stories with data at CMU
Andrew ID: mlaracue

# About me
I'm Maria Lara, a 2nd-year student of the MISM-BIDA 16-month program at Heinz. Before joining CMU, I worked for 6+ years at a people analytics consulting company in Colombia, my home country. For the last year-and-a-half, I led the data science unit. During my time with them, I developed a strong passion for visualizing data and persuading audiences through the use of data and analytics. The first time I heard about the importance of visualizations was thanks to a [TED talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVimVzgtD6w) by Hans Rosling, co-founder of the Gapminder Foundation, who promoted the *intelligent* use of visualizations to explore development issues. If you haven't seen his TED talks, I highly recommend them! It's such a shame he's no longer in this world.

# What I hope to learn
As I'm going to IBM as a data science consultant upon graduation, I want to hone my skills when delivering data-driven results to clients. I've seen how good narrative can be decisive regardless of how sound the analysis can be; if the client doesn't understand the value in what you did and why it matters to them, it's work lost in most cases. I'm confident this course will help me to achieve my goal.

## Visualizing Government Debt
January 30, 2022

### Part 1. Working with web-based visualization tools

### Part 2. Working with Flourish
The visualization below was made with [Flourish](https://flourish.studio) and shows the total debt as percentage of GDP by country and year. The data was downloaded from the [OECD webpage](https://data.oecd.org/gga/general-government-debt.htm).

### Part 3. Applying learned concepts

In general, the previous two visualizations made it difficult to get insights at a glance; Although simple, the first graph does not provide valuable information beyond the ordering of countries according to debt -which could also have been achieved using a table. Conversely, the second graph offers too much information to process and makes it difficult to make comparisons across countries.

I chose the slope chart to reveal trends that the audience may not have identified using the first two charts. Moreover, it condenses the data using a 5-year interval and highlights what I expect the audience to get from the visualization (using a different opacity for the countries I want them to ignore). Needless to say, the title already conveys the most relevant finding. Hence, the audience knows right away what they're looking at.
